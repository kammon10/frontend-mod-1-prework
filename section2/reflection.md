## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

 -I tend to get sucked into problem solving mode and wait far to long. I need to start setting a timer once I get thoroughly stuck on something.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

-I really liked having less support, it was nice having the extra help but I like working to solve puzzles as well. It was definitely a bit scary but knowing I could get help if I hit a brick wall was reassuring.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

-A conditional statement is or an "if, else" statement is used when direction is dependent on a condition. "if" the pizza is cold, then you warm it up. "else" the pizza is hot "then" then its ready to eat. This would be used on the play button of a video.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

-You would first us an 'if' statement and set the first conditions, if there are multiple conditions, us the "else if" statements for each condition along with a block of code to be executed for each condition.
use the "else" statement for any condition not directly outlined above.


1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

-You can use Replit to run parts of code before running an entire block.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

-no questions at this time.
