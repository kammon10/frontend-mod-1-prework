## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-embracing learning as a lifestyle and not a journey with a specific destination. We learn from an early age that school is a means to an end, a short (or long) term undertaking with and end point. After dedicating a specific number of year to a goal, we expect to be finished with our education and home free with a career. Life long learners however see the education step as the career, gaining knowledge is a part of the lifestyle and deeply valued for the experience as well as the outcome. I love this mindset and they key take away was beautiful.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
-I utilize a growth mindset with every aspect of Jiu-Jitsu and music. Neither of these hobbies have an end in sight. The journey is the whole point and seeking a deeper understanding is the focus of both of the passions. I do not employ a growth mindset to social media or mindless pass times. a growth mindset is a conscious decision and expending energy on something that does very little for the betterment of myself or others is not something I'm willing to invest energy into.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain. An array would be used to list videos or songs in a playlist.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
-Array methods are used to manipulate positions in an array. We can use methods to organize, change values, add or remove positions ect.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
-loops are used when we want to iterate over several positions in an array. We can use this for counting, increments (up or down), adding variables and printing the sum.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
-imagine you line up your favorite toys and count from the beginning (0,1,2..) you end up with 5 toys in a row. you can name your toys if you want. You want the computer to tell you how many toys you have. A loop will put your toys in order and tell you how many toys you have. And if you gave them names, it will tell you their names as well.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
-Can you make a loop run functions in an index?
