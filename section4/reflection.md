## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My workfow felt good! I still struggle with asking for help after only 20 minuets of work, however taking frequent breaks and walking around helped with my focus.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  I do find my focus drift especially when I get caught up thinking up variable names to use occasionally, but overall I have noticed a significant improvement. I was worried my focus would be worse then it was and was pleasantly surprised when I didn't struggle with long hours of concentration. (I contribute much of that to the breaks).

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  An object is used to represent a "thing" and contains variables that are used to list parts of this thing(properties).
  An array is a list of data stored in a single variable.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - I would use an array because a list of names only describes one variable. An array can also sort alphabetically.

  * List of states and their capitals
  - I would use an object. This is a list of two variables and it is a thing.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - an array would be useful for this. it describes a single list of items used for one purpose.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - Again an array would be good for this collection of data. This list only describes one variable, "Instagram accounts"

  * List of student names and their cohort
  - I would use an object for this. the Object would be "Turing", and the properties would be "Students", and "Cohort".

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  -This would be an object. The object or "thing" would be the cake and the properties would be ingredients and measurements

  * All my favorite restaurants
  -This would be an array because it only describes one variable.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- Purchasing a flight ticket on Frontier Airlines. Keys that would show up are flights on the dates, destination, and departure location. Once a flight is chosen, a method would be used to redirect you to chose a seat, baggage and insurance.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
- How do I make a property into an array?
