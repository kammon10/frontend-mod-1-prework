## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

- I loved how the article described learning as a process and not a just a step to an end goal. developing a love for the journey and continuing curiosity into your professional life is crucial especially in this industry.
  I already take care of my brain and take frequent breaks and read obsessively, but I need to start teaching what I've learned more frequently.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
- first we learned about numbers. This includes positive, negitive and decimals or "floating type" numbers.
the next data type is a string which is just a line of text. Strings are inclosed with parentheses.
We also have booleans which just means a "true" or "false" statement(all lower case). Finely we have arrays which is a list of things in one variable.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
- console.log("hello World!!");


4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments -- in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
A double back slash // is used to comment out a line in code. We use these for annotation of code, notes to ourselves about what a specific line if code does or even an entire code block. We also use this to communicate with someone else who might be looking at our code.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a thing kind of like your toys. We name your favorite toys so when we want to play with one, we can just ask for it by name.  


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three  
- Variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
on youtube, a variable used would be "playLists" this would be an array of my favorited videos. It would have a boolean variable for the like button and a string variable for my user name.  

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- concatenation means to combine two or more things and combine them into one action.


8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
- My online calculator uses concatenation for math operations

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- Can you make a variable in an array into its own array?
